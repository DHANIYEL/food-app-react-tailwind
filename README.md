# Food App

This repository houses the code for an interactive food app-website, built with the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS. Users can explore a visually appealing and responsive interface to discover delicious dishes, potentially navigate through categories, and (depending on the implemented features) interact with the menus in an engaging way.
